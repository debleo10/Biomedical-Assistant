## Abstract

In Drosophila, architectural proteins are frequently found in promoters, including those of genes
with extremely high expression levels, such as ribosomal protein genes (RPGs). The involvement of
several of these proteins in gene regulation in Drosophila has been shown, but the exact mechanisms
of their possible cooperative action have not been fully elucidated.  In this study we dissected the
contribution of the architectural proteins Opbp and M1BP, which are co-localized at several RPG
promoters near the transcription start site, to promoter functioning. We found that Opbp has two
domains that directly interact with CP190, Putzig (Pzg), and Chromator (Chro) proteins, the
cofactors which are required for the activation of housekeeping (hk) gene promoters. These domains
have redundant functions in vivo and can tether the cofactors forming open chromatin regions when
are artificially recruited to the "closed" chromatin. Additionally, we observed interactions between
M1BP and the same cofactors. In the transgene assay, the transcription driven by the 192-bp part of
Rpl27A RPG promoter is fully dependent on the presence of at least one Opbp or M1BP binding site and
it is sufficient for the very high activity of this promoter integrated into the hk gene cluster and
moderate expression outside the cluster, while presence of both sites even more facilitates
transcription.  This study demonstrates that different architectural proteins can work independently
and in cooperation and fulfill partially redundant functions in the activation of RPG promoters.
