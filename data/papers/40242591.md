## Abstract

The development of precise and efficient delivery systems is pivotal for advancing CRISPR/Cas9 gene-
editing technologies, particularly for therapeutic applications. Engineered metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs) have emerged as a promising class of inorganic nonviral vectors, offering unique advantages
such as tunable porosity, high cargo-loading capacity, and biocompatibility. This review explores
the design and application of MOF-based nanoplatforms tailored for the targeted delivery of
CRISPR/Cas9 components, aiming to enhance gene-editing precision and efficiency. By incorporating
stimuli-responsive linkers and bioactive ligands, these MOFs enable controlled release of
CRISPR/Cas9 payloads at the target site. Comparative discussions demonstrate superior performance of
MOFs over conventional nonviral systems in terms of stability, transfection efficiency, and reduced
off-target effects. Additionally, the intracellular trafficking mechanisms and the therapeutic
potential of these platforms in preclinical models are discussed. These findings highlight the
transformative potential of MOF-based delivery systems in overcoming the challenges associated with
gene-editing technologies, such as immunogenicity and cytotoxicity, paving the way for their
application in precision medicine. This review provides a blueprint for the integration of
nanotechnology and genome editing, advancing the frontier of nonviral therapeutic delivery systems.
