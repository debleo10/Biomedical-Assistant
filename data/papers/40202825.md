## Abstract

Adipocytes from white adipose tissue support cancer progression by supplying fatty acids to tumor
cells while cold-activated brown adipose tissue has been shown to inhibit tumor growth by disrupting
cancer cell metabolism. In a groundbreaking study published in Nature Biotechnology, Nguyen and
colleagues developed Adipose-Modified Therapy (AMT), a strategy that genetically reprograms white
adipocytes to outcompete tumors for key nutrients. Using CRISPR activation technology, researchers
enhanced adipocyte glucose and fatty acid consumption, by inducing a stable browning phenotype. In
vitro, browned adipocytes reduced glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation in cancer cells, inhibiting
their proliferation. Implantation of engineered adipose organoids adjacent to tumors suppressed
tumor growth, reduced angiogenesis, and altered metabolic gene expression in xenograft models. AMT
also prevented tumor development in genetic mouse models of cancer, suggesting a role in cancer
prevention. Finally, modified human mammary adipocytes inhibited the growth of patient-derived
breast cancer organoids. This therapy, based on autologous fat transplantation, could offer a
reversible and patient-specific approach. Challenges remain, including metabolic plasticity in
cancer cells and the fragility of mature adipocytes in cell culture. AMT represents a paradigm shift
in cancer therapy, leveraging adipocytes as metabolic competitors rather than tumor facilitators,
opening new avenues for metabolism-targeted cancer treatments.
