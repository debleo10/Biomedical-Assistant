## Abstract

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by immune dysregulation,
heterogeneous clinical phenotypes, and a complex interplay of pathogenic mechanisms. RNA-binding
proteins (RBPs), which orchestrate post-transcriptional gene regulation through dynamic interactions
with target transcripts, are increasingly implicated in autoimmune pathogenesis. However, the cell-
type-specific heterogeneity of RBPs expression and their regulatory networks in SLE remain poorly
characterized.  To delineate RBPs dynamics in SLE skin microenvironment, we conducted a
comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of publicly accessible single cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA-seq) datasets from lesional skin biopsies of SLE patients and healthy controls (HC). Cell-
type-specific RBPs expression patterns were systematically profiled across epidermal keratinocytes,
dermal endothelial cells, and T cells. Complementary bulk RNA-Seq analyses employing Splicing Site
Usage Variation Analysis (SUVA) were performed to identify immune gene-associated regulatory
alternative splicing (RAS) events. Integrative co-expression networks linking RBPs, RAS events, and
immune pathways were subsequently constructed.  Single-cell resolution revealed marked heterogeneity
in RBPs expression across keratinocyte, endothelial cell, and T cell in SLE compared to HC. Notably,
disease-specific RBPs were enriched in pathways governing interferon response, cytokine signaling,
and leukocyte activation. Cross-analysis with bulk transcriptomic data highlighted JUN and HLA-A as
hub regulators exhibiting elevated expression in SLE T cells. Network modeling further uncovered
coordinated interactions between JUN, HLA-A, and RAS events in immune genes, implicating their
synergistic roles in modulating T cell effector functions.  Our multi-omics integration identifies
JUN and HLA-A as central coordinators of alternative splicing programs in SLE T cells. These
molecular hubs, embedded within immune regulatory networks, may drive pathogenic rewiring of T cell
responses in SLE.
