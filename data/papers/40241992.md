## Abstract

The CRISPR system has emerged as a ground-breaking gene-editing tool, offering promising therapeutic
potential for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe genetic disorder affecting approximately 1
in 5000 male births globally. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which encodes a
critical membrane-associated protein essential for maintaining muscle structure, function and
repair. Patients with DMD experience progressive muscle degeneration, loss of ambulation,
respiratory insufficiency, and cardiac failure, with most succumbing to the disease by their third
decade of life. Despite the well-characterized genetic basis of DMD, curative treatments- such as
exon skipping therapies, micro-dystrophin, and steroids- remain elusive. Recent preclinical studies
have demonstrated the promise of CRISPR-based approaches in restoring dystrophin expression across
various models, including human cells, murine systems, and large animal models. These advancements
highlight the potential of gene editing to fundamentally alter the trajectory of the disease.
However, significant challenges persist, including immunogenicity, off-target effects, and limited
editing efficiency, which hinder clinical translation. This review provides a comprehensive analysis
of the latest developments in CRISPR-based therapeutic strategies for DMD. It emphasizes the need
for further innovation in gene-editing technologies, delivery systems, and rigorous safety
evaluations to overcome current barriers and harness the full potential of CRISPR/Cas as a durable
and effective treatment for DMD.
