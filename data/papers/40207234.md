## Abstract

Thymically committed regulatory CD4 T cells (tTregs) are essential for immune homeostasis and self-
tolerance. We established the human tTreg Expression Signature by comparing genome-wide
transcriptomic profiles between tTregs and their conventional counterparts (tTconvs). We further
exploited the high sequencing depth of our bulk RNA-seq data to identify a subset of 250 genes
significantly expressed in human tTregs and with neglectable expression in tTconvs, defined as below
the levels of expression of <i>IL2RA</i>, that we named thymic Treg "private" genes. Notably,
pathways related to cell motility, inflammation, and T-cell effector specification were
overrepresented within the tTreg private genes. We found that 163 of these genes were significantly
less expressed in circulating na√Øve and memory Tregs when compared to peripheral data generated in
parallel. This result suggested a higher activity for most of the "private" genes in the thymus when
compared to the peripheral compartments. Altogether, we provide a unique resource to inform future
studies, such as for improving annotation in single-cell and spatial transcriptional data, or help
in designing human studies to validate putative biomarkers for thymically committed Tregs, a
priority in the field.
