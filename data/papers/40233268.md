## Abstract

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is caused by altered maturation and differentiation of myeloid blasts,
as well as transcriptional/epigenetic alterations and impaired apoptosis, all of which lead to
excessive proliferation of malignant blood cells in the bone marrow. It is these mutations that
cause tumor heterogeneity, which is linked to a higher risk of relapse and death and makes anti-AML
treatments like HSCT, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy (ICI, CAR T-cell-based therapies, and cancer
vaccines) less effective. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) also makes it possible to find
cellular subclones and profile tumors, which opens up new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for
better AML management. The HSCT process works better when genetic and transcriptional information
about the patient and donor stem cells is collected. This saves time and lowers the risk of harmful
side effects happening in the body.
