## Abstract

Insufficient infiltration of cytotoxic lymphocytes to solid tumors limits the efficacy of
immunotherapies and cell therapies. Here, we report a programmable mechanism to mobilize Natural
Killer (NK) and T cells to breast cancer tumors by engineering these cells to express orphan and
metabolite-sensing G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). First, in vivo and in vitro CRISPR
activation screens in NK-92 cells identified <i>GPR183</i> , <i>GPR84</i> , <i>GPR34</i> ,
<i>GPR18</i> , <i>FPR3</i> , and <i>LPAR2</i> as top enhancers of both tumor infiltration and
chemotaxis to breast cancer. These genes equip NK and T cells with the ability to sense and migrate
to chemoattracting metabolites such as 7Î±,25-dihydroxycholesterol and other factors released from
breast cancer. Based on Perturb-seq and functional investigations, GPR183 also enhances effector
functions, such that engineering NK and CAR NK cells to express GPR183 enhances their ability to
migrate to, infiltrate, and control breast cancer tumors. Our study uncovered metabolite-based tumor
immune recruitment mechanisms, opening avenues for spatially targeted cell therapies.
