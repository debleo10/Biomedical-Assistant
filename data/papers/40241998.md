## Abstract

The coexistence of trisomy 21 and cystic fibrosis (CF) is extremely rare, with fewer than 10
reported cases, all involving homozygous CFTR mutations. However, the impact of a heterozygous CFTR
mutation in a patient with trisomy 21 remains unexplored. We present a male infant with trisomy 21
who experienced recurrent respiratory distress and was later found to carry a heterozygous
pathogenic CFTR mutation (p.Phe508del). His respiratory complications were severe, requiring
tracheostomy and long-term respiratory support. This case highlights the potential interplay between
trisomy 21-associated anatomical features and CFTR-related airway abnormalities, possibly
exacerbating respiratory morbidity. Given the high burden of respiratory complications in both
conditions, clinicians should consider CFTR-related disorders in patients with trisomy 21 presenting
with severe respiratory issues. Further research is warranted to determine the clinical significance
of CFTR heterozygosity in trisomy 21 and its implications for disease severity and management.
