## Abstract

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) presents varying prognoses in pediatric and adult patients, with
dysregulated m6A-related genes playing a pivotal role in its pathogenesis. Through an analysis of
single-cell RNA sequencing data from the Gene Expression Omnibus, we uncovered distinct patterns of
m6A gene expression specific to pediatric AML cases. Additionally, we devised a Lasso risk
regression model to evaluate prognosis within different AML subsets, showcasing the clinical utility
of m6A-related genes in predicting AML outcomes. Our study underscores the unique and significant
m6A gene expression profiles observed in pediatric AML, emphasizing their potential relevance in
prognostic assessment. The demonstrated effectiveness of the Lasso risk regression model further
underscores the importance of m6A-related genes as valuable predictors of AML outcomes. These
findings not only unveil novel insights into the prognostic implications of m6A-related genes in
pediatric AML but also advocate for their application as prognostic markers to enhance personalized
treatment strategies in both pediatric and adult AML populations.
