## Abstract

Myocarditis is a common inflammatory heart disease in children and young adults, with fulminant
myocarditis (FM) being the most severe form due to its rapid onset and high mortality rate. However,
the precise pathological immune subsets and molecular change in myocarditis, particularly FM, remain
unknown.  We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of pediatric peripheral blood mononuclear cells
during the acute and recovery phases of FM. A viral myocarditis (MC) mouse model was established
using CVB3. Deletion and adoptive transfer of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, as well as blockade of CXCR4,
were conducted in vivo. CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells were sorted and cultivated in vitro, then stimulated
with CXCL12 and CXCR4 antagonists to investigate the mechanism of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell
overactivation.  CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells show significant activation, amplification, enhanced
cytotoxicity, and increased chemotactic ability in FM. Deletion of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells alleviates
myocardial injury and improves cardiac function in MC mice, while adoptive transfer of
CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells from MC mice aggravates myocardial inflammation and injury. The
transcriptomic analysis reveals elevated CXCR4 expression in CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in acute FM. In
vitro experiments demonstrate that the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis drives the overactivation and cytotoxicity
of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells. In vivo treatment with a CXCR4 antagonist effectively reduces
CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell accumulation in the heart, alleviates myocardial inflammation, and improves
cardiac function in MC mice.  These findings provide deeper insights into the immune landscape of
pediatric FM, uncovering a novel role of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in driving CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell
responses in myocarditis. Furthermore, they highlight the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis as a promising
therapeutic target for myocarditis treatment.
