## Abstract

Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a severe cardiovascular complication that adversely affects the heart
health of diabetic patients. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of propionate on
the cardiac fibrosis phenotype in diabetic mice and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms.  A
streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse model was used in the experiments. After successful induction
of diabetes, the mice received propionate treatment. Cardiac fibrosis and inflammatory factor levels
were assessed using histological analysis and biochemical assays. Furthermore, single-cell RNA
sequencing and primary mouse cardiac fibroblast sequencing data were analyzed to explore the
potential mechanisms underlying propionate's effects on diabetic cardiac fibrosis. Finally, the
molecular mechanism by which propionate reverses diabetes-induced cardiac fibrosis was validated
using shRNA knockdown experiments.  The results showed that propionate treatment significantly
improved cardiac fibrosis in diabetic mice and reduced the levels of inflammatory factors in cardiac
tissues. Additionally, propionate upregulated the expression of the Serpinf1 gene, inhibited the
abnormal activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, and reduced fibrosis and marker expression levels
in high-glucose-induced cardiac fibroblasts.  The main conclusion of this study is that propionate
effectively improves the diabetic cardiac fibrosis phenotype in mice, and this therapeutic effect is
specific to pathological conditions. The study further identifies Serpinf1 as the molecular target
of propionate's action. These findings not only enhance our understanding of the pathophysiological
mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy but also provide new strategic insights for diabetes
treatment, holding significant clinical application potential.
