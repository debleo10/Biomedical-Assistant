## Abstract

Oxidative phosphorylation defects result in now intractable mitochondrial diseases (MD) with cardiac
involvement markedly affecting prognosis. The mechanisms underlying the transition from compensation
to dysfunction in response to metabolic deficiency remain unclear. Here, we used spatially resolved
transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on the heart of a patient with
mitochondrial cardiomyopathy (MCM), combined with an MCM mouse model with cardiac-specific Ndufs6
knockdown (FS6KD). Cardiomyocytes demonstrated the most heterogeneous expression landscape among
cell types caused by metabolic perturbation, and pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed dynamic
cellular states transitioning from compensation to severe compromise. This progression coincided
with the transient up-regulation of a transcription factor, <i>ATF3</i>. Genetic ablation of
<i>Atf3</i> in FS6KD corroborated its pivotal role, effectively delaying cardiomyopathy progression
in a female-specific manner. Our findings highlight a fate-determining role of <i>ATF3</i> in female
MCM progression and that the latest transcriptomic analysis will help decipher the mechanisms
underlying MD progression.
