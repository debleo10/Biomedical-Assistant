## Abstract

To explore the role of transketolase (TKT) in the immunotherapy and prognosis of hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC).  TKT expression across various cancers and its associations with tumor immunity and
prognosis were analyzed using nomogram models. A multi-omics approach was employed, including bulk
RNA-seq analysis, methylation profiling, single-cell analysis, and spatial transcriptomics.
Experimental methods included RT-qPCR, siRNA transfection, luciferase reporter assay, and chromatin
immunoprecipitation.  TKT was significantly upregulated in multiple cancers and correlated with
immune cell infiltration, particularly in HCC. Elevated TKT expression was associated with poor
overall survival (OS) in HCC and was an independent prognostic factor (p < 0.05). Drug sensitivity
analysis suggested that higher TKT expression was associated with reduced sensitivity to several
chemotherapeutic agents, including sorafenib (p < 0.01). Furthermore, hypermethylation of the TKT
promoter and low TKT expression were linked to improved OS in HCC (log-rank test p = 0.005). Single-
cell analysis revealed that TKT was predominantly expressed in the monocyte/macrophage cluster
associated with HCC, and pseudo-time series analysis highlighted TKT's role in cell differentiation
within this cluster. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the close association between TKT and
macrophage distribution in HCC. Moreover, STAT3 was found to directly regulate TKT expression by
binding to its promoter region.  Our findings suggest that TKT may play a role in tumor immunity and
prognosis in HCC. Although these results provide insights into the potential involvement of TKT in
immune cell infiltration and survival outcomes, further studies are required to fully elucidate its
role in immunotherapy.
