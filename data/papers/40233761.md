## Abstract

Widespread delivery of therapeutic proteins to the brain remains challenging. To determine whether
human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-microglia (iMG) could enable brain-wide and pathology-
responsive delivery of therapeutic cargo, we utilized CRISPR gene editing to engineer iMG to express
the Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin under control of the plaque-responsive promoter, CD9. To further
determine whether increased engraftment enhances efficacy, we utilized a CSF1R-inhibitor resistance
approach. Interestingly, both localized and brain-wide engraftment in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice
reduced multiple biochemical measures of pathology. However, within the plaque-dense subiculum,
reductions in plaque load, dystrophic neurites, and astrogliosis and preservation of neuronal
density were only achieved following widespread microglial engraftment. Lastly, we examined chimeric
models of breast cancer brain metastases and demyelination, demonstrating that iMG adopt diverse
transcriptional responses to differing neuropathologies, which could be harnessed to enable
widespread and pathology-responsive delivery of therapeutics to the CNS.
