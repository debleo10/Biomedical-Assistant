## Abstract

Pyroptosis, a lytic inflammatory cell death mechanism, plays dual roles in tumorigenesis, but its
clinical relevance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains poorly understood. Through an integrative
analysis of 40 pyroptosis-related genes in newly diagnosed AML patients (TCGA, n = 151) and healthy
controls (GTEx, n = 386), we identified 32 genes with aberrant expression. Among these, 9 genes were
found to be significant prognostic markers, including ELANE (protective), and CASP1, CHMP4B, BAK1,
and CHMP2A (risk), which retained their prognostic significance after adjusting for age and gender.
Using unsupervised nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) on TCGA data, we classified AML into two
pyroptosis patterns: the ELANE<sup>high</sup> subtype, associated with favorable survival, and the
ELANE<sup>low</sup> subtype, which was enriched in poor karyotypes and adverse outcomes. This
classification was validated in an independent cohort (GSE10358, n = 91). Single-cell RNA sequencing
data (GSE116256, n = 15) revealed that the ELANE<sup>low</sup> subtype is characterized by an
immunologically active microenvironment, marked by an expansion of cytotoxic T cells and naive
CD4 + /CD8 + T cells. Factor analysis revealed associations between pyroptosis patterns and other
forms of cell death, including ferroptosis, autophagy, and apoptosis, as well as with karyotype,
leukemia stemness, and TP53/FLT3-ITD mutations. Prognostic immune gene sets enriched in the
ELANE<sup>low</sup> subtype were associated with interferon signaling and ubiquitin-mediated
degradation pathways. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis identified
three sub-networks and nine key hub genes. This study integrates gene expression data from newly
diagnosed AML patients, revealing the heterogeneity of pyroptosis patterns within the population. It
highlights the potential links between distinct pyroptosis patterns, the immune microenvironment,
various cell death pathways, leukemia stemness, and genomic alterations, offering novel biomarkers
and therapeutic targets for risk stratification and immunomodulatory interventions in AML.
