## Abstract

The molecular mechanisms underlying adrenal and thyroid neuroendocrine tumors, including their
tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis, involve unique pathways regulating cell cycle
progression. To better understand these mechanisms and pathways, extensive in-depth research on cell
cycle-related genes is necessary. This review aims to describe and interpret current single-cell RNA
sequencing studies on neuroblastoma, medullary thyroid cancer, and pheochromocytoma tumors. Our
review summarizes differentially expressed cell cycle-related genes with distinct functions,
highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets and components of panels used to determine tumor
type or aggressiveness. Although some insights have been gained, there is still limited information
on these topics, and further research is required to explore the regulatory mechanisms of these
tumors.
